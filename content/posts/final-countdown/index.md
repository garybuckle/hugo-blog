“The reason we race isn't so much to beat each other,... but to be with each other” — Christopher McDougall, Born to Run:

The start towards the start line

Training is over, whatever I do now is not going to significantly impact the performance in Berlin on Sunday. Meaning that if I go out and drag myself through a 21km or a fast 10km, the impact of such training wouldn't really impact the race result on sunday. I am not absolutely sure of that though, in the past I have often tried to cram in runs in the last days. One thing is certain for me, in my head. I have done enough to get me round the course in the desired time, no point in doing anymore. What is left now is to avoid anything that might negatively impact that. For me it means no squash, no running, no alcohol and some nice walks. Squash is too explosive and would increase injury risk. Running wouldn't help, see above and also might cause me to incur an injury. Alcohol will impact my heart rate, general health and sleep, I normally drink a lot less weeks before an event and definitely nothing a week before. Nice walks are going to make me happy, realised and expose me to the countryside. On Sunday Colleen and I are going to immerse ourselves in the Marathon. In my experience and opinion it's the whole package, the nerves, the doubts, the crowds, the part of being involved in something. Then the performance, the various stages that you traverse through both mentally and physically. Finally of course the finish, that is for a lot of people the best bit. I cant say I don't look forward to seeing the finish but as soon as you stop, your body realises that it's in a bit of pain. Normally my legs cramp up badly and although I want to sit, I can't. Better to walk around a bit, like a zombie. The obvious thoughts about why do I do this? until the next time!

The next time is Sunday and actually, in Cologne the Sunday after that. Where I have a different goal!
