The photo is 5 years old! In 2017 a very good friend and myself ventured to Berlin in order to run the Marathon. 
5 years later I am back again but this time with [Colleen](href=https://colleenanderhub.co.uk) my daughter. 
She is attempting her first marathon and together we are going to blast through the Brandenburg gate in around 4 hours.
Berlin is one of my favourites, as is Köln (more about that to come). T
here is very definitely an international vibe along with tte fact that you're running on the same tarmac that [Eliud Kipchoge](href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge) is running on, the current world record holder. 
That's a bit special! We have 5 weeks and 5 days left to go and Colleen is beginning to realise that those 42km are getting closer. 
She's prepared pretty well with some great runs around Berlin, she's already pretty fit and she's definitely streamlined. 
The crowds will pull us through! The event will summon up the adrenaline, the dopamine, the endorphins and the mind and body will slide along through the streets of Berlin. 
The wall, the runners wall will not be a factor because just like the Berlin wall we will pull it down! For me it's another marathon in another great city somewhere. 
I am not stopping yet. Now I am going to write about those 10 plus Köln marathons I have done. Until then ... keep on running!
