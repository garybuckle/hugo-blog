# Via Claudia Augusta Tour 2024

## Via Claudia Augusta - The Start

Some time ago a good friend of mine told me that his dream was to cycle from Bavaria in southern Germany, across the alps and finish at Lake Garda in Italy, along a route called Via Claudia Augusta.

I don't know why but I said I would love to do it too, I'm not even much of a cyclist and I don't even own a bicycle. Or at least one that was good enough to cross the alps!

So the die was cast and Uwe (pronounced Oovah) and I (mostly Uwe) set about organising the trip. I thought about buying a bike and finally accepted Uwe's kind offer of using his beautiful Specialized Gravel Bike. Gravel bikes are not quite racing bikes and not quite mountain bikes. They can handle both environments.

We (mostly Uwe) set out 9 Etappen (routes) on an app called Komoot, a mixture of cycle paths, trails and gravel paths. A route that would allow us to get to where we wanted and still allow time for a lot of sight seeing.

On Saturday the 20th of July we packed our bags and bikes and, along with Heike, drove the 7 hours down to Heike's moms in beautiful Algäu, Bavaria. After dropping Heike off we cycled to Oberammergau, our starting point. It wasn't really the first phase we intended but none the less it was a great start.

I set up my tent in a field and Uwe slept in his van.

So on Sunday the 12st of July we started out from the camping site in Oberammergau and climbed our first 1000m to Biberwier, crossing the border into Austria. We saw no beavers although the name in German means Beaver river or something along those lines.
