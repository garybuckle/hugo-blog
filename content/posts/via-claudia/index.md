# Via Claudia Augusta Tour 2024

## Via Claudia Augusta - The Start

Some time ago a good friend of mine told me that his dream was to cycle from Bavaria in southern Germany, across the alps and finish at Lake Garda in Italy, along a route called Via Claudia Augusta.

I don't know why but I said I would love to do it too, I'm not even much of a cyclist and I don't even own a bicycle. Or at least one that was good enough to cross the alps!

So the die was cast and Uwe (pronounced Oovah) and I (mostly Uwe) set about organising the trip. I thought about buying a bike and finally accepted Uwe's kind offer of using his beautiful Specialized Gravel Bike. Gravel bikes are not quite racing bikes and not quite mountain bikes. They can handle both environments.

We (mostly Uwe) set out 9 Etappen (routes) on an app called Komoot, a mixture of cycle paths, trails and gravel paths. A route that would allow us to get to where we wanted and still allow time for a lot of sight seeing.

On Saturday the 20th of July we packed our bags and bikes and, along with Heike, drove the 7 hours down to Heike's moms in beautiful Algäu, Bavaria. After dropping Heike off we cycled to Oberammergau, our starting point. It wasn't really the first phase we intended but none the less it was a great start.

I set up my tent in a field and Uwe slept in his van.

So on Sunday the 12st of July we started out from the camping site in Oberammergau and climbed our first 1000m to Biberwier, crossing the border into Austria. We saw no beavers although the name in German means Beaver river or something along those lines.

<em> Mountains...you never tire of them!

The weather was kind to us as we cycled down the Ettaler pass, a steep downhill road leading the way through Tyrol, in the distance Germany's highest mountain the Zugspitze, flanked by two large glaciers.

Uwe was a keen and able photographer and took great lengths to get the perfect picture. Here he is crossing a field, If I hadn't have stopped him who knows how close he would have got to that mountain. I think he was actually trying to run away from me!

Uwe went one better and laughed at them!

<em> Uwe's socks told the story!

Although we (mainly Uwe) had planned to follow the Via Claudia Augusta to Riva, there were detours that we had planned (mainly Uwe) that would take us to some cool places. On that note, we departed the Via Claudia Augusta route, headed up and then down into the Eibsee

<em> The Eibsee!

The climb was worth it, Eibsee is a stunning lake.

In we plunged, after chatting to an Australian and his girlfriend who conceded that tackling some of the tracks on a gravel bike was ambitious because the tracks were Gnarly. He wasn't wrong.

Uwe showed me some advanced cooling techniques that only a true biker knows.

After the thrill of Eibsee we climbed a good 400m towards our destination, Biberwier. Place of beavers!

Slowly, very slowly, the weather changed. Becoming colder, not cold but definitely the degrees were dropping and a cool breeze cooled us. We suspected after consulting our weather apps, the more the better actually because they all gave us various answers, that we might hit a storm.

I wasn't afraid of a bit of wind and rain and neither was Uwe.

At 15:40 we passed Mordor.

<em> Mordor!

Yes it looked like the place that Sauron would have chosen.

Those large dark clouds warned us of what was to come.

Three kilometres to go before we arrived at our apartment so we didn't care and on we rode.

Until the water came down and the wild wind howled. We scarpered underneath the overhang of a large barn, thank you universe for putting it right there.

After a few seconds though I declared that we should just continue, it's only water I said to Uwe. So we put on our raincoats. A storm wasn't going to stop us, we only had 3km to go.

So off we went into the storm.

The storm and the universe threw hailstones at us, turned the wind up to maximum and Thor threw down Mjölnir his trusted hammer, sending down spears of lightning on to the ground around us. I was scared as we capitulated and dragged ourselves and our bikes back to the shelter of the barn overhang. We were defeated and shocked but happy not be in the storm at least.

We laughed and I realised how stupid I had been to think we could out-cycle the weather.

For the next 20 minutes it howled down until slowly it burnt itself out down and that was our cue to cycle the last 3km.

<em> But Sauron was not of mortal flesh, and though he was robbed now of that shape in which he had wrought so great an evil, so that he could never again appear fair to the eyes of Men, yet his spirit arose out of the deep and passed as a shadow and a black wind over the sea, and came back to Middle-earth and to Mordor that was his home. There he took up again his great Ring in Barad-dur, and dwelt there, dark and silent, until he wrought himself a new guise, an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure. Thank you Mr Tolkien!
