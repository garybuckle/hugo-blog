## Running past the Katzensteine

This was a great find, the sandstone rocks! The forest and the fact that  it is less than 3km away from where we live. I have looked up the rocks  on  [Wikipedia](href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzensteine ), they're old, very old. I have no idea what the area is specifically called, it's definitely on the edge of the [Eifel National Park](href=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalpark_Eifel).
I am slowly starting to discover how great this place is to run around. 
You can see my route (one of many) on [Komoot](href=https://www.komoot.com/tour/1070513190). 
I'm going to share a bit of info here on my running experience around  this part of Mechernich. 
I am equipped with a healthy appreciation of the beauty of the natural  surroundings, this tends to already lift my mood somewhat.
Then there  are the endorphins, they appear a few kilometers into the run. 
I always  try to do at least 16km and sometimes 21km, if I am feeling extra buoyant then I will do 30km. 
In addition to the endorphins and the forest I have a 21st century invention, Podcasts. 
For the Katzensteine  and forest runs such as this one I have -  The  [Blind Boy podcast](href=https://play.acast.com/s/blindboy)
It's a classic!

A fantastic journey through the world of story-telling.
No matter what episode, the narrators skillful portrayal of mythology and history is simply delightful and for some reason, 
it just compliments the greenery of the Eifel landscape. 
Listening to the blind boy podcast made me think about what it means to be out here amongst the trees, breathing heavily as I climb the hills. The Katzensteine seem like an intrusion from the past, dropped into the 21st century to remind us that there is still stone and rocks yet they belong here more than I do. When I get to the top I always pause to take a look around and thats a reminder to do that in life, pause, consider where you are, take a few breaths, you are tiny here in the middle of something ages old. It doesn't make you meaningless but it reframes 'your' meaning. I am just someone playing a temporary role in something bigger, older. There is no meaning other than the meaning I have brought here with me. Back I go to the blind boy podcast....
