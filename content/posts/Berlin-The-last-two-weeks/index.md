Tapering

Two weeks to go before Berlin, personally it's been a busy time. Our house is a Baustelle, a building site, wires hanging out of the half finished walls, everything covered in dust. Still a lot of things to do. My only escape is running but I'm not really running that much now because in two weeks myself and Colleen are taking part in the Berlin Marathon. So I am taking it easy but while I remember, Here is a bit about Colleen and her sponsorship. So officially I am tapering, there are a lot of different takes on how to taper but basically you aim to be at your peak on the day of the race. Personally I have tried a few varied approaches and honestly couldn't say if either of them worked, it's all very much anecdotal. So I cannot really offer any solid advice other than work it out for yourselves! Not very helpful. That said at my ripe old age I am mostly aiming not to get injured. For me it means running less, playing less squash, eating healthily and running slower or at least with a lower heart rate. Tapering for me is testing your running style, how do your legs feel? not stressing about pace.

On Sunday I cycled 53 km in the Ardennes, Belgium, it was meant to be a fun few hours in stunning countryside, it turned out to be quite difficult. So I decided to run between 10km and 12km on Tuesday at a slow pace and again on Thursday. My 'take it easy' hat is now fully sitting on my head, I am chillin'

One thing I will advise and please feel free to correct me or comment upon this, the advantages of running in low heart rate zones. Running or performing in Zone 2 or 3 has been an absolute revaluation for me over the last 5 years or so. After spending most of my running life NOT doing this and a furious discussion with a very good friend of mine in which I completely disagreed with his "Gary, run in zone 2 or 3" mantra, I have come to my senses. My good friend has run many ultra's and therefore qualifies in my opinion to know a bit about running üòÄ. So running in lower zones is actually pretty useful and I find it's a good time to think about your running style and breathing.

Tapering is finding the mental space to not run, something that is difficult for runners who find having a day off hard! In less than two weeks we will be giving our all around the very flat Berlin marathon course, along with Eliud Kipchoge, who might be a few km ahead ü•π. So yesterday (Tuesday) I did a 12km route to Katzvey, past the Katzensteine ,Satzvey and up the hill past the Wildpark to home. I waited for the Installateuer to reconnect the water and bingo!!! I had a shower. En Route... I decided not to absorb my mind in a podcast but a few tunes. Tunes are what feed me before marathons and its mostly African or Cumbia but it could be anything, even Pink Floyd! So yesterday's tune that popped up after switching to Local Files due to no network

was......11:59 a song that took me back to 1978.

I leave you with...

Pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night
Take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean
Wait until the morning, take tomorrow by the hand
Take it down the highway like a rocket to the ocean, we can run
