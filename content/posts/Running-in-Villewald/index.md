## Running in the forests of Germany

I (we) arrived in Weilerswist in September, a small town outside of Cologne. I had already committed to running the Cologne Marathon and whilst training for that event I discovered the Erft. I like running alongside the banks of rivers or canals anyway but it's flat, very flat. That said, the flatness of the Erft got me ready for the flatness of Cologne so I am not complaining. Running along the Erft though, did not feed my soul in the same way running in the forest did and still does. Linslade Woods or Rushmere being great examples. So here I am discovering Villewald on my own! It was a slow process and I logged my routes on Komoot, in fact thanks to Komoot I managed to find my way through the paths that are not shown on normal maps like google maps or apple maps. So actually I can highly recommend Komoot. Villewald is a really nice place to run, it's not flat either and there are a few lakes to run around. Now I feel that my soul is being fed!
