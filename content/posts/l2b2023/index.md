> Once you descend into that dark place out on the trail, where everything is crashing down around you, you need to find something real to keep you moving. It could be love or pain, but it has to be real. It certainly won’t be Facebook likes.” 

We travelled over by train on Friday evening, meeting up with Sean at St Pancras at around 7:30. He was a bit knackered, we were a bit knackered so we opted out of meeting up and eating together. Heike and I were in Richmond town centre so we found an Italian restaurant and took our seats outside. To our left, 2 blokes kitted out for what seemed like a long run and to our left and elderly woman who we had previously passed limping along the street. The fit blokes were obviously doing the L2B and I eavesdropped a bit. Not their first ultra but definitely their first 100km. They discussed future events pending their success on Saturday. I demolished spinach ravioli, two bottles of sparkling water and an espresso affogato. The lady on our right finished at approximately the same time as us and as she rose I couldn't help but notice a t-shirt adorned with the Jurassic coast 100km ultra logo. Aha! She was also doing the L2B. As she passed I wished her good luck. She thanked me and asked me if I too was running, I told her it was my first time and that I was running with my son who'd run it last year. She wished me luck and told me that she'd run the Jurassic coast 100km a week earlier. I was genuinely speechless and told her so. "Oh it's nothing at all, I do them all the time. I'm not fast but I just keep going"

I still couldn't see how this woman who was clearly struggling to be mobile could do 200km in the space of 8 days. That sounded like a good mantra and one my mom would have approved of so just keep going it was.

I woke the next day at 5:30 and made my way to meet Sean at the station in Richmond.

10 minutes later we were there at the start, drinking coffee and eating oat bars. As with most sporting events, the atmosphere is incredible! We checked our gear and lined up at the start, both of us trying hard to conceal our excitement.

I did a better job than Sean who was clearly really looking forwarded to this. I was too but in all honesty I was facing a distance I hadn't yet run. I was indebted to his positivity. it set us up for what was going to be one of those days that you wont ever forget

Off we went at a nice, relaxing pace. Past some park runners who seemed to be sprinting! along the Thames to Kingston upon Thames, Ashley's old hunting ground. I was transported back to those days, beery evenings in the pub and evenings at the red rose Indian restaurant in Surbiton with Ashley.

We chatted along with the other runners as we made our way through the housing estates of south London, Maldon, Happy Valley and Chaldon. The leafy suburbs of Surrey finally gave way to the High Weald National Landscape, the garden of England. We trod the paths the ancients had taken on their way to the coast of old Albion. We were both transported back to the Sunday mornings in Leighton Buzzard and Dunstable Downs as we chatted continually about sport, politics, family and future. Ducking under the M25 motorway and into the sticks, Sean became super charged as his feet padded along the wooded trails. I kept up and couldn't stop myself thinking about his first 10km about 6 or 7 years ago in Leighton Buzzard. He obviously struggled and Colleen and I had to cajole him into trudging on. Here he was after 30km or so cruising, lapping it up, cheering others on, he had become a machine!

Slowly, as the kilometres faded away, my tank began to empty and I was now the one flagging. In my head I was trying to see a way to complete the 50km or so we had left, my legs were telling me that they couldn't do 4 let alone 40. I became silent and sluggish but in front of us, Sean pushed me on, reminding me that at the midway aid station we can reset. I couldn't see or didn't want to see how an aid station would transform my flagging moral and revitalise my broken legs. I pushed on as his optimism and spirit dragged me along. Eventually we were within reach of the aid station, I happily wolfed down some veggie pasta, a couple of cans of fizzy drinks (I wouldn't go near them normally), a coffee and stocked up on tribe bars. We also changed our tops and removed our shoes to let our feet breathe a bit, oh how good that felt! Reset we did and I couldn't believe the response as we ran out of the aid station heading south to Brighton. Now I was feeling good as we crossed fields full of cows and sheep, the endless gates and styles posing problems for our ragged legs.

We celebrated the fact that we only had another Marathon to do!

My mind was developing another relationship with distance and time.

Somehow as we headed out across the north downs, our spirits were lifted and I was beginning to believe what Sean had never doubted. The destination was in sight!

The last 20km was met with hoops and cheers as we approached Burgess Hill.

We texted our support team at the last aid station, telling them we only had 12km to go.

At this point we only had the hill just after Plumpton to contend with.

It was a bad one that hill, it was the kind of thing that wiped out your hope when you're looking at the bottle of Champers, contemplating how the cork will be removed. That hill could have been a killer if it had been a few km earlier. As it was, we laughed at it and soon it was history.

Downhill!!! we sprinted downhill, well.. it seemed that way. Gone were the chains that had dragged around our legs.

Now we could smell the sea!

We counted down the last 5km as Sean shouted at me to forget the distance, head for the lights of the Racecourse, his pace increasing as we closed in. I have no idea how I kept up with him!

Our unbelievable support team broke into cheers as we hit the final straight.

I couldn't quite believe what had happened but here we where. My legs were sadly gone as I tottered around, I had no control over them anymore.

One thing that is very important to mention, at least for me. This was a shared experience, so no the lonelyness of the long distance runner here. Sharing it with Sean and then of course sharing it with the group. The videos and pictures that we sent on route are a great way of feeling connected. We all need to feel connected and we all love to share experiences. You're alone but not that alone, its the freedom to test and push your body and mind in a safe environment.

I am writing this a few days later wishing I was back out there whilst when I was back out there I was counting down the kilometres.

It was an unbelievable experience, full of surprises as in the surprise that I can actually run a 100km. An experience shared with my oldest offspring who tried to convince me a few years ago that he was a sprinter but he would give running a go. Now he's a Kung Fu running master! it's his domain. Somehow I always knew his deliberate, relaxed style would suit ultra running. Anyway he knocked off 3 hours from last years time and I am pretty sure he'll knock off another 3 next year. There's a part of me saying I ought to be out there with him again!

Thanks to Heike, Chloe and Alicia for being there for us at the end when we needed you!

Thanks to Sean for pulling me through, putting up with me for 100km and providing the spirit we needed when we had none!

He's put so much into running over the last few years, he deserved that result.

There was a lady in Stone Cross who used to say, don't stop, keep moving.

So we do!
