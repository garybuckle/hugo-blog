“The Devil whispered in my ear: ‘You’re not strong enough to withstand the storm.’ I whispered back: ‘I am the storm'”

The picture above is my son Sean Buckle who ran a 100km from London to Brighton this time last year. He never stopped smiling! This year he has convinced me to run it with him. I've run one Ultra before and if you're not sure what an Ultra is then I asked ChatGPT for you and...

An ultramarathon is any footrace longer than the traditional marathon distance of 26.2 miles (42.195 kilometers)

As always I find it such an incredible experience when running with my siblings, maybe because my two brothers and myself used to run a lot together in the past. There is definitely a huge legacy. I've run with all my kids and recently did a half in Paris with Jennifer my niece. Such a fantastic experience! Running a 100km with Sean is a massive event for both of us. I seriously cannot wait!

I think I have prepared enough, running the forests and hills around the Eifel, including running in zone 2 far below my anaerobic threshold for the last month. Normally I just blast around but that's not the way to prepare for an Ultra. Well!!! lets see how it goes, I'm sure Sean will pull me along, if anyone is yet to sponsor him a couple of quid then please click here.

Massive thanks to all those of you who have already contributed, it always blows me away how generous you are. He is raising funds for mental health.

So now I am off to pack all of this stuff into my bag.

You're wondering why I need all that stuff, plasters, tape, salt tablets, figs, headtorch, spare socks, spare underwear, Vaseline, iPhone charger and a kitchen sink.

No... there is no kitchen sink.

Better to have it than not, not the kitchen sink but the other stuff and there's bound to be something I forgot!

My next post will be post the 100km, wish us luck!
