# Welcome!

## I’m Gary
I like to code,
run marathons and ultra marathons, play squash, I love running in the hills and forests. In fact I love running - full stop 

I decided to start a blog to share my thoughts and experiences.

Mostly around running.

I know....

blogs are so 2006!

Hang on! nothing wrong with 2006. There were some decent bands out there.
I ran my first <a href="https://generali-koeln-marathon.de/en/" target="_blank">Köln Marathon</a> in 2006.
Maybe I should blog that but I probably can't remember how it went. Mostly because of the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6lsch_(beer)" target="_blank">Kölsch</a>.

I could have just popped all of this on one of the popular blogging sites but I decided to hatch my own blogging site. I had a webpage until recently running on a framework called 
<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">NextJS</a>, it's great but I wanted something a little more simple, less reliant on upgrades.

So I'm giving a mini shout out to <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>

and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> because it's so easy to create content with.

It's so nice and simple.

Here's the  [posts](/posts/).
