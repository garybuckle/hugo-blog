Welcome to my website, This picture was taken while out running in Linslade, Bedfordshire, England, the (un) United Kingdom.

Linslade is famous for the great train robbery

The very spot I am standing on is actually not that far from the bridge where the robbery took place.

The area itself is beautiful and I used to love running around the meadows and woods.

I left it all behind. We moved to Germany, finally ending up in Kommern, we are now the Kommern people!

As for this website, it's very much a work in progress.

I have plans to turn this into something useful. I just need a bit more time! Mostly I would like to talk a lot more about running, squash, fitness, robotics, technology, coding and electronics. 

If this sounds interesting then... Stick around and see what develops, when the time comes I will start filling up the pages.
